Many Taiwanese websites suffer from basic web accessibility issues that make the sites difficult to use for everyone, but especially those with difficulty seeing, motor issues with their hands, or, people that don't speak fluent Mandarin and want to use translation tools. Lots of these issues are quite simple and could be fixed quite easily, such as the improper usage of images as text, or displaying alerts using `window.alert()`. 

In Taiwan, there are engineers with free time and a desire to give back to Taiwan. Some are immigrants (such as me) who are looking for opportunities to justify their presence in Taiwan when they apply for their APRC! And finally, there are new engineers that are looking for opportunities to get real projects on their portfolio. 

Twa11y aims to combine these two facts, by sourcing and listing web accessibility errors we find on social-good Taiwanese websites. Our goal is, after compiling such a list, we can present it to the organization in charge of a given website, and offer to fix these issues for free. Everyone wins!

Social-good websites are things such as government or hospital websites. 

This repository is used primarily to track web accessibility issues we find, tracked under the "Issues" tab, above.
